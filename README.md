# GoogleGeminiExploreRepo

<h3>Gemini Explorer</h3>

The code creates a chat program using steamlit. The chat is powered by the Google Gemini Pro. The user can interact with the model powered by Google Gemini.

<h5>Problem Statement</h5>
Through this project, I aimed to create a chat program power by Google Gemini generative model. As a beginner in AI Engineering, I made this project a learning experience in exploring and utilizing Google Gemini. 

<h5>Methodology</h5>
1. Set up the Google Cloud 
  a. Created a Google Cloud account
  b. Created the Gemini_explorer project
  c. Set up billing information and enabled for the project

2. Installed the Google Cloud SDK and set up the CLI
  a. Set up default credentials for the authentication

3. Set up the Google Gemini model
  a. Imported the necessary libraries such as verertexai and streamlit
  b. specified the configurations for the model
  c. Initialized the generative AI model using Gemini pro

4. Code the chat program using Python and Streamlit

<h5>Testing</h5>
The chat program was tested by checking the accuracy and the validity of the prompt responses to the different queries asked.

<h5>Conclusion</h5>
Creating a simple chat program using Google Gemini is a good way to learn about Gemini and Steamlit.
